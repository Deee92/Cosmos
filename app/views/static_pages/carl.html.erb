    Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 â€“ December 20, 1996) was an American
    astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science
    popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural
    sciences. His contributions were central to the discovery of the high
    surface temperatures of Venus. However, he is best known for his
    contributions to the scientific research of extraterrestrial life,
    including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from
    basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages
    that were sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record,
    universal messages that could potentially be understood by any
    extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them.

    He published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author,
    co-author or editor of more than 20 books. Sagan is known for many of his
    popular science books, such as The Dragons of Eden, Broca's Brain and Pale Blue
    Dot, and for the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,
    which he narrated and co-wrote. The most widely watched series in the history of
    American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people
    across 60 different countries. The book Cosmos was published to accompany the
    series. He also wrote the science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997
    film of the same name.

    Sagan always advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method,
    pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence
    (SETI). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell
    University, where he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and
    his works received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA Distinguished
    Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal,
    the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book The Dragons of Eden,
    and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award
    and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After
    suffering from myelodysplasia, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 on
    December 20, 1996.
